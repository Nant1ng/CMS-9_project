Name
Our project is a schoolproject based on a blogsystem created for a fake company named Millhouse Co.

Description
Our schoolproject is created so admin and users can register and login. Later on an admin can create new blogposts and save them in the blog and in a database. Users are able to comment and provide the customer with useful feed-back of the products shown in the blog.


Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. We have no such thing.

Installation/Usage
A good requirement if one chooses to work with this project is to have a good program to work with the code. In our case we chose to work with Visual Studio Code.

And as the project is based to save data in a database it’s essential to have a good database installed in your localhost. Such as “mySql” https://www.mysql.com/, “XAMP” https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html or programs were one can save data from the blog.

Support
Being a school-project the blog is not designed for users to be able to ask for help from us the creators. If one is interesting in PHP specifically, please look in the php manual: https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php 

Roadmap
Being a school-project for a specific period of time we have no further intention on evolving this blog further in the future.

Contributing
We have no intention on accepting contributions and have no requirements.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.


Authors and acknowledgment
We have no special authors and acknowledgments to thank for the project except for our teacher Anders Andersson.
For the design we have inspiration for Isabella Löwengrips blog:

Project status
With more time we might have been able to make some more changes. But for the sake of the deadline for the schoolproject we have chosen to leave it as it is.
